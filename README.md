# Ping Check
A little and simple project built with **Django** using **BeautifulSoup** and **requests** to practice more Python. It was inspired by [a very similar tool](https://jamesdiffeycoding-pythonlivedashboard.vercel.app/) built by [James Diffey](https://github.com/jamesdiffeycoding).  

The app simply sends `GET` requests to my deployed projects to keep them from spinning down and check it receive a `200` status code as well as scraping for some HTML content.

## Roadmap
- Planning to set up a maile that would notify me when an error occurs.
